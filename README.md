# Welcome!

I wanted to make my personal site show off some of the cool skills I've acquired
over the years.  This repo is pretty barebones right now, but I'm hoping to:


1. Create a documented, unit-tested, and authorized API and front-end you can play with.
2. Have your interactions with be seen by other people in a fun way (maybe like
a pointillism piece)
3. Show off my code skills
4. Implement accessibility
5. Implement internationalization (from a proof of concept POV, unfortunately
I'm only fluent in English but I'll try!)
